and Sylvain Poitras for converting the Max external to a Pd external and creating the Organelle patch Pd-Grids.

I modified the Organelle patch to make it work with the Zynthian synthesizer controls and added a simple free-running FM synth and 
a seperate mono FM synth to be controlled be a midi keyboard.
